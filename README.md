I would like to build a mobile app called "HooNooks". It will be designed to help UVA students discover ideal study spots around Grounds based on their individual preferences. The app would feature filters for noise level, seating type, natural lighting, outlet availability, and proximity to food or bathrooms. A live crowd meter would estimate how busy each location is through student check-ins, while a mood-based suggestion tool could recommend spots based on how users are feeling (e.g., focused, social, relaxed). Students could leave reviews, share photos, and bookmark favorite locations, with optional notifications about crowd levels or space closures. Additional features might include walking directions and a rotating “Spot of the Week” to encourage exploration. By making it easier to find the right environment, HooNooks aims to help students improve focus, reduce stress, and make better use of the many study spaces across UVA’s campus.

## Notes

One challenge I encountered while building the app was using GitHub. When I cloned my repository, it unexpectedly removed all the files from the original folder that my Xcode project was connected to, which caused the simulator to stop running. After some troubleshooting, I was able to reconnect Xcode to the cloned repository and get everything working again. I also had some difficulty adjusting to Xcode since I had never used it before, but once I got the hang of it, I found it really enjoyable to explore and experiment with.
